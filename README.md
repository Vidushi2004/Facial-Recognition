# Facial-recognition

Facial recognition is the ability of a computer to identify a person based on an image of their face. This is a classification problem, where each possible person is a class, and the provided image should lead to one specific class with as high certainty as feasible.
Dataset:
In this exercise, the dataset Olivetti Faces provided by scikit-learn will be used. This dataset comprises 400 images for 40 different persons, with exactly 10 images per person. The dataset is labelled, meaning that the correct class for each image is known.
